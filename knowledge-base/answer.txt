LLM Answer:
Accrued and unclaimed HR remains available for claim up to 3 6 months (configurable) post cancellation (Document 1,
Document 2). 
In cases of a renewed policy cancellation, accumulated HR points need to be rolled back to the previous year's 
policy (in the HR portal) so they can be utilized if the policy is rebooked (Document 3). 
A refund should not be generated for a Health Return receipt (Document 3).

The information provided describes the rollback process for HR points, 
but doesn't explain what happens to all aspects of HR in a cancellation. 
Further details about other potential HR impacts 
(e.g., if claims are active and in progress, what happens to them upon cancellation) are missing from the provided context.
